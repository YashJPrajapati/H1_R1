### Key Design Decisions
1. **Microservices Approach**: Separated concerns into distinct apps (auth, processing, analytics)
2. **Async Processing**: Background tasks for heavy document operations
3. **Mock Mode**: Development-friendly testing without backend dependencies
4. **Modular Design**: Pluggable translation providers and OCR engines
5. **Security First**: JWT tokens, rate limiting, input validation
